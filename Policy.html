        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>Last updated: November 2025</p>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>This Privacy Policy explains how the individual creator operating the "InstaClashed" content channel manages
            data related to the use of their private software tools ("Service"). As this Service is for internal,
            individual use, data collection is minimal.</p>

        <h2>2. Data Collection and Use</h2>
        <p>The Service is designed to operate **locally** whenever possible. The following data points *may* be
            collected or processed:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Simulation Data:</strong> Replay files (.replay) and statistics files (.stats.json) generated
                during simulation runs are stored locally in the designated replay/data directories.</li>
            <li><strong>Campaign/Job Data:</strong> Data stored in the local database (database.json) contains job
                titles, player names, dates, and status flags.</li>
            <li><strong>External API Data:</strong> If the Caption Generation feature is used, the input data (job
                titles, player names) and the response from the third-party AI service (Cerebras) are processed
                temporarily in memory to generate the title. This data is not intentionally stored long-term by the
                Service operator, though it passes through external servers.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>No personally identifiable information (PII) of third parties (e.g., viewers, customers) is collected or
            stored by this Service.</p>

        <h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>No data collected or generated by the Service is shared with any third parties, except as strictly necessary
            for the operation of external services like the AI API for caption generation.</p>

        <h2>4. Jurisdiction</h2>
        <p>The User (creator) is based in **Lithuania**, and the data processing adheres to the context of individual,
            private creative activity.</p>

        <h2>5. Contact Information</h2>
        <p>For any questions regarding this policy, please contact the operator at:
            <strong>instaclashed@gmail.com</strong></p>
